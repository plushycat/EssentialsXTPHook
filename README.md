# EssentialsXTPHook
Adds click functionality to TPA requests for EssentialsX

## Adds a clickable [✔] and [✘] to the `/tpa` and `/tpahere` requests sent via EssentialsX.
### Also comes with configurable sounds to notify players of teleport requests, as well as while accepting and rejecting them.

# Requires EssentialsX to run!!

Made it for personal use, but thought I'd share it anyway for others who relate to the pain of silent and tedious EssentialsX teleport requests. 

### NOTE
No updates or support is guaranteed. Sounds and messages are configurable. If this plugin requires updates, interested developers are free to fork and publish updates, as long as this page, and I, the original creator are credited.


## Happy Minecrafting!
